# PursuedPyBear SDL2 Based Subsystems

This is a support library for ppb-core related projects. It provides a renderer,
input maps, sound, and font rendering utilities using C-Types and PySDL2.

Unless you're building your own flavor of ppb, you probably just want to use
the ppb package instead of this one.
